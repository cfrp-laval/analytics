-- local development mode:

# main repository:  https://github.com/cfrp-laval/analytics.git

npm start                                        #Â start the client UI locally


-- staging deploys:

# staging site:  http://cfrp-laval.github.io/analytics/

# The staging site is hosted on Github Pages and lives in the gh-pages git branch in
# two commits.  The first contains configuration for serving from the url above
# (you can view these with 'git diff gh-pages~1^!').

# The second commit is rewritten on every staging deploy, and contains build
# artefacts.  e.g. here is a recipe to update the staging site to show new commits
# on the branch 'ulaval-design-integration':

git checkout gh-pages
git rebase ulaval-design-integration             # rewrite staging branch to include new commits
npm run build                                    # bundle sources with webpack
npm run cache-bust                               # optional: cache-bust the bundle url in index.html
git commit -a --amend --no-edit                  # rewrite the second gh-pages commit to include bundle
git push origin gh-pages --force                 # push to github pages

# NB gh-pages is a 'throw away' branch.  So it's safe to rebase and force-push
# (but ONLY on gh-pages, not on the trunk).
